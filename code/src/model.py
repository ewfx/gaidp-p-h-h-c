Assume all fields referenced in the rules belong to a single table, and use the exact field names provided. Ensure the SQL queries include standard SQL syntax for filtering, validation, and flagging transactions. Handle data type checks, range validations, format compliance, and missing/null value checks. Use logical operators such as AND, OR, and functions like IS NULL, LIKE, and BETWEEN appropriately. Write the queries in a consistent format for readability and execution, and return the full record when the condition is met using SELECT * or the relevant fields. The output should be a JSON array, with each object containing the rule and the corresponding query.
